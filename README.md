## Projects Included

| Project Name | Description | Technologies Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Alphabet Recognition using CNN** | A Convolutional Neural Network built with TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten alphabet characters from the EMNIST dataset. | `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib` |
| **2. Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN** | A CNN model trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize and predict handwritten digits (0-9). The model is also tested on custom images. | `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `NumPy`, `OpenCV` |
